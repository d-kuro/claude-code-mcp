# exit_plan_mode
Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished presenting your plan and are ready to code. This will prompt the user to exit plan mode.

```typescript
{
  // The plan you came up with, that you want to run by the user for approval. Supports markdown. The plan should be pretty concise.
  plan: string;
}
```
